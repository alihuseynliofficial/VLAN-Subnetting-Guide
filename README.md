# VLAN Subnetting Guide

This repository contains a **practical and theoretical guide** for VLAN subnetting, including **Network ID, First Usable IP, Last Usable IP, and Broadcast IP**.

It is designed for **cybersecurity students** or anyone learning network fundamentals.

## Files Included:

- **Presentation (PDF)**: [(./VLAN Subnetting.pdf)](https://github.com/alihuseynliofficial/VLAN-Subnetting-Guide/blob/main/VLAN%20Subnetting%20Network%20ID%2C%20Broadcast%2C%20and%20IP%20Visibility.pdf) – Visual explanation of subnetting concepts.  
- **Video Demo**: Watch the video on YouTube [here][(YOUR_YOUTUBE_LINK_HERE)](https://youtu.be/HPOvLz-1bCA?si=W1hT6CtLFH4m6QOV) – Practical and theoretical explanation.

## Key Learning Objectives:

1. Understand VLAN subnetting concepts and terminology.  
2. Calculate network ranges and verify if IPs belong to the same VLAN.  
3. Analyze communication between devices in the same VLAN.

## Summary Table (Example):
