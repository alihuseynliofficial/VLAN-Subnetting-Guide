# VLAN Subnetting Guide

This repository contains a **practical and theoretical guide** for VLAN subnetting, including **Network ID, First Usable IP, Last Usable IP, and Broadcast IP**.

It is designed for **cybersecurity students** or anyone learning network fundamentals.

## 📂 Files Included

- **Presentation (PDF)**: [Slides.pdf](./Slides.pdf) – Visual explanation of subnetting concepts.  
- **Video Demo**: Watch the video on YouTube [here][(YOUR_YOUTUBE_LINK_HERE)](https://youtu.be/HPOvLz-1bCA?si=W1hT6CtLFH4m6QOV) – Practical and theoretical explanation.

## ✅ Key Learning Objectives

1. Understand VLAN subnetting concepts and terminology.  
2. Calculate network ranges and verify if IPs belong to the same VLAN.  
3. Analyze communication between devices in the same VLAN.

## 📝 Summary Table (Example)

| Property            | Value             |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Network ID         | 192.168.96.0/20 |
